#Building API model from RAML

Building an API model is handled by `org.aml.typesystem.yaml` artifact and is as simple as following sample

```java
Api api=(Api) new TopLevelRamlModelBuilder().build(store, new CompositeResourceLoader(),"some.raml");
```

Key class here is [TopLevelRamlModelBuilder](https://github.com/OnPositive/aml/blob/master/org.aml.typesystem.yaml/src/main/java/org/aml/typesystem/ramlreader/TopLevelRamlModelBuilder.java)

the result is an implementation of interfaces from [CommonInterfaces](https://github.com/OnPositive/aml/tree/master/org.aml.model/src/main/java/org/aml/apimodel)

At this moment both RAML 0.8 and RAML 1.0 are supported.
